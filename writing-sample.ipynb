    "# Make a technical writing sample with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks can give technical writers a versatile way to share their work. Unlike a static site generator, such as Jekyll, you can host a dynamic Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate both your writing and executable code samples. Or, you can print a static version of your content to PDF or HTML. To make a Jupyter Notebook and host it on Binder requires that you can competently work through a very common workflow for software documentation writers, who frequently use Markdown and Git day to day.\n",

    "4. Use [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/), to create a remote host for your notebooks.\n",

    "## Install and set up Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "First, you need to install and set up Jupyter Notebooks on your Mac. Jupyter Notebooks are automatically installed with Anaconda, a Python distribution platform that includes Python 3 as well as some other scientific computing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and set up Anaconda and Jupyter by downloading the Anaconda binaries distribution from [Anaconda.org](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos). Then follow the installer wizard steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** By default, this installer modifies your bash profile to activate the base environment of Anaconda3 when your shell starts up. The default installation works for most people but to disable this, choose **Customize** at the **Installation Type** phase, and disable the **Modify PATH** option. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. After the installer finishes, open a terminal by navigating to **Applications**>>**Utilities**>>**Terminal** or with Spotlight. Then, check that Anaconda installed correctly by running `conda –version`, which prints the version you installed in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check that Jupyter is running correctly by running the command `jupyter –version`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If either Jupyter or Anaconda are not working as expected, common Anaconda installation issues are resolved in the [Troubleshooting Docs](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/) and [Jupyter Docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/troubleshooting.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can also access Jupyter with the Anaconda navigator, which provides a GUI for you to select which tool you want to use. This can be convenient, however, if you open Jupyter Notebooks from the navigator, it automatically opens the Jupyter server to the directory where Anaconda is installed, which might be a different location from where you want your writing sample. It’s better to launch Jupyter from a terminal window in VS Code instead of the navigator, if you're using VS Code for your writing environment.\n",
