# Writing Samples
This repository includes a Hello World and a sample Jupyter Notebook that you can use to create a technical writing sample as a Jupyter Notebook, then host it on Binder.org or nbviewer. It is written for Mac only at this time.

You can use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lzdanski/Writing-Samples/build-sample?labpath=writing-sample.ipynb) to launch a demo of the writing sample as a Jupyter notebook or see a [static Markdown version](https://github.com/lzdanski/Writing-Samples/blob/master/writing-sample.ipynb).
